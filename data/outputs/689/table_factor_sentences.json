The land is assumed to have remained as barren land in the absence of project activities. Land areas utilized by the project have been purchased by local farmers, which have been planted with native tree species of Gmelina arborea and Albizzia lebbeck. The plantation was initiated in 2002 and was validated as a VCS project in 2011. During the first monitoring period (15 June 2002 to 31 December 2009), 36784 tCO2e were sequestered by the project activity. The current monitoring period that this report assesses is from 1 January 2010 through 31 July 2012. During this period net GHG removals by the project were 19,699 tCO2e. As the buffer risk factor is 11%, the total VCU issuance after buffer deduction is 17,532 VCUs. In June-2014, an external stakeholder identified an error in the use of the root to shoot default factor used by the proponent resulting in a reduction in the GHG removals and VCU issuance for this monitoring period and for the previous monitoring period. The total overissuance of VCUs for the monitoring period corresponding to this report was 1589. The total overissuance across all monitoring periods was 8789 VCUs.

The plots are selected by the following steps: i) The project area is first stratified at the primary level on the basis of soil types as illustrated in Table 43. ii) The second level of stratification is done on the basis of species and their age (date of planting). iii) Thus the stratum which has been used as a unit to select plot location is one species of a specific age, eg. Gmelina arborea planted in 2002-03. iv) The tree nearest to the entrance of the plantation is taken as the starting point, irrespective of the direction in which the entrance lies. ―Entrance of plantation‖, implies the main gate of the plantation, which is fixed throughout the project and prominently displayed. v) Next every tree at an interval of ten trees (i.e. 1st tree, 12th tree, 23rd tree and so on in each row) of each row is marked as the reference trees. This is done to prevent bunching up of sampled trees and avoid bias is by concentrating at any one place. vi) Then, the reference trees to be used for sampling are randomly picked up from the list of trees marked earlier with the help of a random number generator. vii) Keeping the reference tree as the centre, a square of 6mx6m is marked and the eight trees surrounding the reference tree are marked A to H in clock-wise direction. Thus each sample plot consists of nine trees, viz. the reference tree and eight surrounding trees. The geographical position (GPS coordinate), administrative location, stratum and stand, series number of each sample plot shall be recorded and archived. It has been ensure that the sampling plots are evenly distributed in the stratum.",

    "summary: The project activity involves plantation on 282.35 ha of degraded land in Chhattisgarh state of India and the capture of carbon from the atmosphere in trees. Carbon pools included in the project are aboveground biomass and belowground biomass. M/s Prakash Industries Limited has commissioned the TÜV NORD JI / CDM Certification Program to carry out the assessment of Risk Analysis a (along with Validation and Verification) of the Project “Reforestation of degraded land in Chhattisgarh, India” located in Durg, Raigarh and Rajnandgaon districts of Chhattisgarh state in India, with regard to the requirements of VCS version 3.0. The assessment is based on the draft Non-Permanence Risk Report/RR1/, revised Non-Permanence Risk Report/RR2/, the project description provided in the validated PD/PD/, the validation report/VR/ and supporting documents/RISK/ made available to the TÜV NORD JI/CDM CP by the project participant. In the course of the verification fifteen (15) Corrective Action Requests (CARs), five (5) Clarification requests were raised and successfully closed. No Forward Action Requests (FARs) were raised. As the result of the assessment, the verifier confirms that the AFOLU buffer credits are calculated without material misstatements in a conservative and appropriate manner. TÜV NORD JI/CDM CP herewith confirms that the project in accordance with the requirements for validation conclusions set out in the VCS Standard version 3 for risk analysis and buffer determination. This report is based on the positive outcome from the assessment of version 3 of the non-permanence risk report evaluation documentation dated 20-10-2011. The non-permanence risk rating for the project is assessed to be 13 which correspond to the buffer reduction of 13%. Therefore GHG removals eligible to be issued as VCUs are 87%.",
