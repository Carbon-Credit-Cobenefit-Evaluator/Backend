    "The project generates net positive impacts on the social and economic well‑being of the local communities who derive livelihoods from the project area.",
    "This may come through carbon finance revenue, as in the proposed project activity.",
    "Therefore, withholding a portion of the project’s carbon benefits from capped markets will result in greater overall climate‑change mitigation.",
    "The proposed project activity promotes community participation in plantation.",
    "Enhancing the carbon sink through reforestation, reclaiming degraded land sustainably, reducing pressure on natural forests in the region, and uplifting the social and economic status of rural people.",
    "The project can sell these carbon benefits in voluntary markets or retire them.",
    "Indicators of the same are visible in: socio‑economic well‑being: The project activity has benefited the lives of native rural people by providing regular year‑round employment at the doorstep and free fuel wood and fodder.",
    "Less than 20 percent of households living within 20 km of the project boundary, who rely on the project, have been consulted; the project generates net positive impacts on the social and economic well‑being of the local communities who derive livelihoods from the project area; people in nearby villages have been consulted, as evidenced by the stakeholder consultation report/LSC and confirmed during VCS and CCB validations.",
    "The project area is a revenue area, obtained from the villagers and secluded from the forest lands.",
    "Pressure over the existing forest areas of the state shall be minimized because villagers are receiving an adequate quantity of free fuel wood and fodder adjacent to their households.",
    "There were institutional problems in implementing this project activity, as lands in Chhattisgarh could not be owned by industries after a limit imposed by the Land Ceiling Act.",
    "Projects can sell these carbon benefits in a voluntary market or retire them.",
    "The project area is a revenue area, obtained from the villagers and far from natural forest lands.",
    "The agriculture sector provides a lot of security and incentive to farmers in the form of subsidies, support prices, soft loans, and income‑tax concessions.",
    "The project proponents must show that capacity building is structured to accommodate the needs of communities, not only of the project; findings conformance CAR/OBS: they are helping nearby villages by sponsoring school teachers, participating in Durga Puja, and sponsoring football and cricket matches between nearby communities.",

    "The project team is experienced in forestry, with more than ten years of experience, and is based locally.",
    "People from other local areas appreciated the project for providing free‑of‑cost fodder and fuel wood.",
    "In addition, local farmers are usually unable to fully finance forest establishment because it is difficult for them to obtain loans from banks for reforestation activities (loans for agricultural activities are much easier to obtain). Therefore, without the proposed reforestation project activity, the project area will not be reforested, and with the project activity the goals of the ongoing reforestation programs or policies will not be reduced.",
    "The project aims to sequester carbon through planting and maintaining trees.",
    "This is also a result of the fact that the land on which the project is based has been purchased from local communities.",
    "A number of factors have been identified as major constraints, including time‑consuming and complicated procedures for accessing land, restrictions on harvesting and selling trees, delays in sanctioning and disbursement of bank credit, non‑remunerative prices for tree products, and flawed public policies and programmes.",

    "All surplus biomass produced is collected by local communities for fuelwood or fodder.",
    "As a result, the potential productivity per unit area of the lands has not been achieved for many years, resulting in poor socio‑economic conditions that have left farmers living in dismal conditions.",
    "There was no pool of funds to manage the financial implication of the project.",
    "It also assists the supply of forest products like fuel and fodder to meet the local demands.",
    "Planting: Seedlings raised in the nursery were planted in the main plantation with a spacing of 3 m × 3 m.",
    "The environmental benefits and ecosystem services that the project caters to are of greater interest and significance than the minimal negative impacts.",
    "Justify that any non‑native species used by the project are superior to native species for generating concrete biodiversity benefits (e.g., for rehabilitating degraded areas unlikely to support natives, or for producing fuelwood that reduces logging pressure on intact ecosystems). Findings: Prakash uses only native species in the project, namely Gmelina arborea (Gamhar/Khamara) and Albizia lebbeck (Kala Siris).",
