    "This demonstrates that the forest has historically faced—and will continue to face—intensive logging pressure unless the land can be used to generate alternative income streams.",
    "The project proponents’ future capacity to log their native forests may be constrained by policy shifts.",
    "This will support local biodiversity conservation, maintain watersheds, and enhance carbon stocks.",
    "Logging has historically provided a major source of employment and income, and environmental campaigns for forest conservation have arguably not recognised the socio‑economic impact of banning logging of native forests.",
    "Rather, IFM projects will stop not only logging of native forests within the project area, but also establish carbon finance as a competitive land use.",
    "The local community benefits from the conservation of the native forest.",
    "The project scenario involves protecting native forest.",
    "Indeed, historical logging of the project site, recent logging concessions, and ongoing logging in the region demonstrate that the risk of deforestation is real, legal, and imminent.",
    "The owners are seeking an alternative which will provide them with a comparable income, while protecting and improving the native forests of the region.",
    "Other Land Use (AFOLU) Project Activities:",
    "This project is on the private land of a family who have owned and logged the land for over one hundred years.",
    "Specifically, these native forests are managed to meet set quotas of high‑quality sawlog (300 000 m³ per annum from 2010 to 2030), with pulp and other wood products produced as byproducts of the sawlog harvesting process.",

    "34. Green, G. (2004). Plantation Forestry in Tasmania: the current resource, current processing and future opportunities. Timber Workers for Forests.",
    "The project activity of improved forest management is not a financially competitive land use without carbon finance, since it generates no other revenue; nor is this type of project common practice in the region.",
    "This is helping to diversify income sources, providing important financial security as the demand for native timber declines, while improving the environmental integrity of the region.",
    "For the majority of the project’s lifetime, the main opportunity cost for the land is the loss of income from harvesting the native forest.",
    "Given the landowner’s intentions and legal right to continue forest harvesting, the continuation of the pre-project activity is only plausible when supported by carbon finance.",
    "The project is specifically eligible under the VCS‑approved “Methodology for Improved Forest Management: Conversion of Logged to Protected Forests”.",
    "This will deter landowners from either ongoing selective logging or converting native forests to plantation or pasture to compensate for the declining revenue from logging.",
    "Rather, they provide one of the few mechanisms to protect native forests while generating a competitive return.",
    "Such action would also negate any landowner income derived from the sale of carbon credits (i.e. the project scenario).",
    "Firstly, it is possible that carbon credits will continue to increase in value, particularly those with biodiversity and socioeconomic premiums like Redd Forests’ projects.",
    "This would serve to renew the pressure on native forests on private and public land and would be evident in ongoing annual verification events for each project.",
    "The owner of the right to harvest is acting as the project proponent and undertaking forest protection as an alternative to harvesting.",
    "Define alternatives to the project activity: The project activity in this scenario involves the continuation of the pre-project land use, i.e. the native forest on site remains standing, using carbon finance to generate revenue from improved forest management.",
    "Summary The pressure on native forests fluctuates, particularly on private land where landowners log in response to market shifts.",
    "The project proponent is seeking to use carbon finance to protect a forest from further logging, particularly the clearfelling that was recently implemented on much of the project site.",
    "Forest, reversal of sequestration is not a risk (compared to, for example, afforestation/reforestation projects).",
    "The historical baseline logging and clearfelling with natural regeneration is a land use that will be continued in the absence of carbon finance.",
    "It is worth noting that constraints on public land may in fact increase the pressure on private native forests.",
    "Moreover, these projects create alternative sources of employment, including fieldwork to assess and monitor forests protected under VCS IFM projects.",
    "(CRC for Forestry: Hobart) The pressure on native forests is intense because landowners believe their future income may be constrained by the shift in demand towards plantation-sourced timber (notably by the proposed Gunns’ pulp mill) and because of high-level discussions about constraining logging of native forests.",
    "It is therefore very plausible that the project proponents will seek to continue protecting their forests using forest carbon projects, rather than resume logging.",
    "However, the project proponent and developer hope that successful projects will encourage the use of VCS and carbon finance by landowners, thereby protecting the biodiversity and carbon sinks of native and old growth forests in Tasmania.",
    "The project activity only generates income from the sale of carbon credits.",
    "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Voluntary Carbon Standard 1.1 Project title: Protection of a Tasmanian Native Forest (Project 1: Redd Forests’ Pilot) 1.2 Type/Category of the project: Improved Forest Management (IFM), specifically conversion of logged forests to protected forests (LtPf) 1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period including project size:",
    "Secondly, there is a high probability of a policy shift towards the end of the project’s lifetime, as social and cultural norms tend towards environmental conservation.",
    "This program was developed by Private Forests Tasmania, a statutory authority funded by the Tasmanian government and private forest owners.",
    "There are unlikely to be significant changes in land opportunity costs between now and 2015, and the landowner will thereafter not be permitted to clearfell the native forests for conversion.",
    "This increases the threat to native forests under existing concessions or in legally permitted logging areas, such as the project site.",
    "By protecting the forest from logging, environmental outcomes such as biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and water quality are safeguarded, compared with the impacts of ongoing selective logging or clearfelling for conversion (which is legally permitted, if not the most plausible baseline scenario).",
    "Given that the project represents passive land management and no infrastructure or large-scale ground disturbance will be associated with this project it does not represent a ‘significant impact’ and therefore does not require referral under the EPBC Act.",
    "The Pilot Project area includes 865 ha of native forest, including small stands of old growth.",
    "This information provides the yield and waste generated under a timber harvest plan of clearfelling with native regeneration.",
    "They will either clearfell their land and allow natural regeneration, which generates the highest possible immediate return; this was historical practice on much of Redd Forests’ pilot project, where a quarter of the property was clearfelled in 2006.",
    "During selective logging, some trees will be left standing to support natural regeneration and allow landowners to achieve maximum sustainable yield.",
    "By avoiding continued forest harvesting and associated habitat destruction, this project will help alleviate the dire pressure on a unique and vulnerable ecosystem.",
    "The project is located in the Northern Midlands of Tasmania, Australia.",
    "Likely land opportunity costs will arise from high prices for animal products (creating a risk of conversion to pasture) or high demand for timber (creating a risk of conversion to plantation or a resumption of logging).",
    "This is because native forests are already harvested at the maximum sustainable rate in response to a steadily declining demand.",
    "The baseline scenario will be extensive selective logging of the standing native forest, followed by natural regeneration.",
    "The project is designed to protect 790 ha of native Tasmanian forest that would, if not for the project, continue to undergo selective logging.",
    "Therefore, although this project will permanently reduce harvest levels within the project area, there is no capacity or incentive for timber harvesting to shift to other forests in Australia.",
    "The timber would be transported by logging trucks along established tracks on the property to the main roads adjacent to it, and from there to one of the woodchip mills at Triabunna on Tasmania’s east coast.",
    "The timber harvest plan developed for each stratum is based on a standing merchantable volume of 149 m³ ha⁻¹ at the project’s start date.",
    "They will either clearfell their land and allow natural regeneration, which generates the highest possible immediate return; this was historical practice on much of Forest Alive’s pilot project, where a quarter of the property was clearfelled in 2006.",
    "This constitutes an annual harvest of private native forests equal to 10 % of the average volume from the preceding 10‑year period.",
    "Alternatively, they will log to obtain the maximum sustainable yield, which involves harvesting roughly 70 % of biomass every twenty to twenty‑five years, as exemplified by the baseline scenario for this project area.",
    "Typically, as the forests recover from logging, the opportunity cost of not logging increases.",
    "It would be financially attractive to log these properties at a sustainable rate to maintain a flow of revenue; in short, the financial incentives support a sustainable selective logging approach.",
    "However, they also have the option of letting the forest stand without any logging or carbon‑financed protection.",
    "Forest Practices Plans (or the state equivalent) are organised by landowners or their representatives.",
    "The creation of the Redd Forests’ pilot project aims to protect native forests from further logging activities and avoid the resulting GHG emissions in an area under great land‑use pressure in the Northern Midlands, Tasmania.",
    "The landowners’ decision to use carbon finance to convert logged forests to protected forests has generated considerable interest across Tasmania.",
    "This is because the project activity seeks to reduce business‑as‑usual carbon emissions through improved forest management; it requires no additional activity beyond preventing the clearance and conversion planned by the landowner.",
    "In this way, severe degradation and loss of biodiversity will continue unless new initiatives allow for improved land management practices, including forest conservation.",
    "Since the project is intended to protect (rather than grow) costs that cause reversal of sequestration and/or protection, regulatory and social risk:",

(2009) The role, values and potential of Australia’s private native forests, Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation 09/049, Australia. v3.1 MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3 Logging of private lands in Australia is managed on a property‑specific basis.",
    "It is therefore unlikely that the government will constrain native timber harvesting due to the loss of income for landowners, and subsequent economic and political costs of compensation.",
    "Since state forests of Australia are harvested according to long‑term quotas, there is no risk that harvesting will be shifted to native forests on public land as a result of the project.",
    "1.4 A brief description of the project: The project is designed to protect 865 hectares of native Tasmanian forest which would, if not for the project, continue to undergo selective logging.",

    "Public forests are harvested to satisfy quotas. State forests (i.e., those on public land) in Tasmania are managed by the government business enterprise Forestry Tasmania.",
    "If logging of native forests is banned, the baseline scenario would resemble the project scenario: the absence of logging would permit the recovery of native forests, and the carbon stocks would be protected and enhanced.",

    "They will be encouraged by the Redd Forests' IFM projects, which enhance the aesthetics of the countryside through forest protection and generate demand for environmental expertise.",
    "A healthy and unlogged forest also creates a more attractive landscape, which is economically important in an area seeking to expand ecotourism income and employment opportunities.",
    "This is recorded both in their Sustainability Charter and in the wood supply agreements with Gunns Ltd and Ta An Tasmania Pty Ltd.",
    "Private native forests across Tasmania (let alone the project area) do not produce enough sawlog timber to affect price.",

    "In 2029, selective logging of 70% of merchantable timber on 135 ha of Class 5 forest regrowth was performed, with monitoring and fieldwork.",
    "Economic risk from rising land opportunity costs is low because the project protects forest rather than grows it, and reversal of protection is unlikely.",
    "The high timber value poses little risk to long‑term carbon stocks because most harvested timber is low‑value pulp, and sawlog production capacity is limited.",
    "In 2009, selective logging of 70% of merchantable timber on 135 ha of Class 5 forest was initiated and validated by CCB, with Redd Forests as responsible agent.",
    "In 2013, selective logging of 70% of merchantable timber on 209 ha of Class 4 forest was monitored by the project proponent.",
    "Regulatory and social risk is very low; the project provides comparable employment to foresters and income to landowners while protecting carbon stocks and biodiversity, reducing political and social tension.",
    "The project enhances the aesthetics of the countryside through forest protection and generates demand for environmental expertise, supporting tourism and professional sectors.",
    "Illegal logging risk is zero; private land harvesting requires landowner consent and is monitored, ensuring negligible impact on forest carbon stocks.",
    "The project generates approximately $48,285 annually from carbon credits, with additional revenue from pulp and sawlog sales.",
