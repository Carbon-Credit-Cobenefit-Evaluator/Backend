The audit team, after extensive desk review, stakeholder interviews, field visit and observation, identified 06 Non- conformances, and 06 Observations communicated in this report through Nonconformity Reports (NCRs) and Observations (OBSs) in Appendix 1. The Non-conformances were successfully resolved and the project’s stated emissions reductions for the January 1st 2011 - Dec 31st 2015 5 have been verified to be free of material error to a reasonable degree of assurance. Project activities focus on forest protection, but include meeting with the local stakeholders surrounding the project area, engaging government officials and local NGOs, implementing the REDD project management and monitoring plans with the help of local partners and contracted staff, undertaking a periodic forest carbon inventory, and modelling deforestation. Activities implemented as part of the project to reduce deforestation include community outreach and employment of local community members as project forest guards or other project staff positions. The scope of the verification included the GHG project implementation; physical infrastructure, activities, technologies and processes of the GHG project; GHG sources, sinks and/or reservoirs; types of GHG’s; and time periods covered. The geographic verification scope was defined by the project boundary, the selected carbon pools, management activities, growth and yield models, forest inventory program, and contract periods. The audit process commenced on January 30th, 2017 with review of the project documentation by the audit team. The proponent provided the audit team with complete and well-justified documentation including the VCS Monitoring and Implementation Report (MIR) for the January 1st 2011 – December 31st 2015 monitoring period, and several dozen supporting documents. Following the pre-field audit document review and sampling plan development, the audit team conducted the field audit from March 20-23, 2017. Field audit activities included direct on-site observations, document review, and stakeholder interviews with local peoples, proponent staff, implementing partner staff, and relevant national government officials. Rainforest Alliance issued the draft audit report for the BCEP VCS verification on 14 April 2017. The project proponent developed responses to all identified Non- Conformity Reports (NCRs) and submitted them to the audit team on May 2nd. The Rainforest Alliance audit team then undertook a second review of project documentation and evidence provided by the project proponent, to which the project proponent responded by June 25th. A third review by Rainforest Alliance was completed, to which the project proponent responded by August 4th.

Ian’s role as Climate Technical Specialist in Rainforest Alliance’s Climate Program involves being an auditor for REDD+ projects for the voluntary carbon market, providing training on REDD+ and climate change to a broad range of groups worldwide, and providing technical leadership on adaptation and mitigation for agriculture and forestry projects. Ian is a forester and resource manager with personal and professional experience in North America, Central and South America, and Africa. His principal interests lie in improving conservation and forest management practices in tropical forests. He has collaborated on a variety of forestry and natural resource management projects in both Amazonia, and the temperate hardwood forests of the Northeastern United States. These projects have included modelling the carbon sequestration potential of various tropical agroforestry systems and designing and participating in several forest inventories in New England to plan timber sales based on natural regeneration. Ian received his Masters degree in Forestry from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies with a focus on tropical forest and resource management, and received his B.A. from Colgate University where he concentrated in Native American Studies with focus on Central and South America. He is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese.",
