In view of the initial characteristics of project area, the auditor agrees that the project has produced substantial local benefits including: quality and availability of water, biodiversity quality (especially wildlife), and job opportunities for local communities. In the interviews with stakeholders, the auditor heard that communities are interested in the plantation activities of the project because they understand the total value and they think the local environmental conditions being improved. Maybe more important are job opportunities because the project zone is located in an impoverished area, and the project gave work to 400 employees. o negative environmental and social impacts were identified by the auditor.

This has enabled the project management to take a long- term perspective on the underlying business opportunity. The pre-project land use and the 2. surrounding area land use support little economic activity, apart from low-density cattle grazing and subsistence agriculture. Without the project activities providing capital investment, the degraded state of the land has prevented alternative land uses such as large-scale agriculture. The degraded land will continue to prevent such alternatives from being implemented in the future. Reforestation is a long-term activity 3. in which the ‘inventory’ accrues value overtime as the trees grow. Although it is possible that land opportunity costs will rise in the surrounding areas (though unlikely, see point 2 above), this will be offset by the rising economic value of trees (in terms of timber value) and carbon on the project land over time.",

Almost no soil productivity, poor physical and chemical characteristics of soil, lack of water sources and low biodiversity in the area described the initial conditions. The project proponent started a rehabilitation program with research institutions and environmental NGOs to recuperate soil conditions before installation of timber plantations. There were several cycles of planting Guaba (Inga spp.) unsuccessfully. Guaba in now part of all plantations models; it is planted in combinations with all timber species. The project proponent has demonstrated its interest in establishing timber plantations in the long term and making overall improvements to environmental conditions in project area.

The other differences between MR and PD are not related with changes in general conditions, but they are a consequence of the adaptive approach of the project: new species, new spacing and new standing models, among others.

This opportunity arises out of the emerging market for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which has emerged since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the ratification of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change and negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol and other international environmental agreements. FM’s business is to address these issues on an integrated, sustainable and ethical basis. SFM is building a global portfolio of forest-based enterprises with the help of commercial, financial, not-for-profit and multilateral partners including leading participants in forestry, bio-prospecting and eco-tourism. SFM’s principal revenues will be derived from supplying and trading carbon dioxide emission credits and offsets in the carbon market and from the harvest of timber from its projects.

    "risk_factor Risk of rising land opportunity costs that cause reversal of sequestration and/or protection; risk_rating Low; campo_verde_project There is always a risk that alternative economic activities will raise land opportunity costs and threaten reversal of sequestration in a project area. This risk, however, is mitigated in several ways in the Campo Verde project. The project is on freehold land 1. owned by the project developer, SFM- BAM. This enables the project management to take a long-term perspective on the underlying business opportunity. The project’s management has 2. specifically targeted this land for reforestation. The lands in the surrounding area currently support little economic activity, apart from low-density cattle grazing and subsistence agriculture. Degradation trends across the project area show that the current state of the lands is likely to persist in its current condition as it has done since the 1980’s. Large scale, commercial cattle ranching was abandoned many years ago due to the economic downturn and terrorist activity, and was not re-established due to the degraded state of the lands and hence the prospect of low returns in the future.",
