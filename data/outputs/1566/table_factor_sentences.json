These actions directly contribute to environmental conservation and the well-being of indigenous communities. Here are some SDGs related to the mentioned activities: SDG 13: Climate Action: Mitigation of climate change through the prevention of deforestation in the forests of the Indigenous Reservation, achieved by implementing the Sustainable Management Plan for Land and Forest. This outcome is further supported by training and socialization workshops for indigenous guards, captains, leaders, and community members to effectively manage natural resources.

The magnitude of the change in this impact is estimated through the following indicators: • Number of members of the Coordinator Committee, number of Cabildos, number of Captains, number of Zonal Coordinators improve and apply knowledge in the statutory and organizational aspects in the surveillance, control and monitoring of the indigenous reservation. Since the beginning of the Project, even from the feasibility stage (2012), training sessions have been carried out for members of the Coordinator Committee, Cabildos Board, community Captains, and Zonal Coordinators of REDD+ Project RIU-SM. Members of Coordinator Committee are 16 indigenous persons, as follows: 1 General Coordinator, 1 General Secretary, 1 Finance Coordinator, 2 Programs and Projects Coordinators, 1 Women Coordinator, 2 Territory and Environment Coordinators, 2 Integral Health Coordinators, 1 Human Rights Coordinator, 2 Life Plans Coordinators, 2 Ethno- education Coordinators, and 1 Youth Coordinator (Annex 2.1.2 of validated PDD - VCS: ACATISEMA Statutes, Article 34). These members are elected every 3 years in the General Assembly of ACATISEMA (where 1 Fiscal Observer and 1 Indigenous Advisor are also elected), in this way, this election process was carried out in 2013, 2016 and 2019 (according to the time the Project has been running). In the training-socialization workshops in which they participate, topics are addressed, among others, those related to governance aspects (autonomy, rights, duties, statutes, legislation), and in the meetings that they develop autonomously they are exercising their governance, in 2012 as it is in Annex 1.1 and in 2013/2014 as it is in Annex 1.2, both of validated PDD – VCS; in 2017 as it is in Annex 2.9 of verified Monitoring Report – VCS 2016-2017; in 2018 as it is in Annexes 1.12, 1.16, 1.17, and in 2019 as it is in Annexes 1.20 and 1.27a, both of verified Monitoring Report – VCS 2018 & 2019.

On the other hand, the flooded native forest and the secondary forest presented a reduction of 130 Ha and 122 Ha respectively, the verification of the MEDIAMOS team found that this loss of coverage was caused by natural processes such as strong winds that deforested large areas and the atypical floods presented in 2018, where forests on the upland of litobiome were submerged for more than four months and all forest species that were exposed to this moisture dried up and died.

The primary forest presented a coverage loose between 2018 and 2019 of 489 Ha, and it is an area where extractive actions of biodiversity are not allowed, the conservation status of this ecosystem is optimal and not Critical values are presented that warrant actions other than those proposed in the sustainable land and forest management plan (control and surveillance and improvement of the quality of heterogeneous agricultural areas for family production). 2.

The data presented indicate a lower level of deforestation for the peinobiome and a negligible value for the lithobiome, and the trend is to maintain that level. On the other hand, referring to the productivity of the biomes, the highest value (which is related to the plant cover) is presented by the zonobiome (1,296.3 Ton / Ha). this biome presents more mature primary forests with taller trees and thicker trunks, and there is also a more closed and abundant canopy. Compared to the lithobiome (351.5 Ton / Ha) it is the lowest value, and they correspond to a small vegetation, with small trees with thin trunks and less foliage. The zonobiome represents the highest biomass compared to other biomes, representing diversity in vegetation, species, sizes, and productivity, generating a variety of microclimates that allow high diversity of species that are related between these biomes and ecosystems that offer opportunities for food, shelter and reproduction to the species that converge in this great ecosystem.",
