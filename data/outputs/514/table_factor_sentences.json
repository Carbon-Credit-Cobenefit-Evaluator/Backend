The rubber tree plantations also have significant climate benefits, such as sequestering an expected 3,900,439 t CO2-e over 42 years. In 2016 the community benefits document include 302 permanent jobs with legal benefits, training, and health benefits. The project complies with all local laws, has public consultations processes to inform local stakeholders about project activity, development and monitoring. Most workers receive specialized training for their specific tasks. This year project areas have a grievance process in use in order to better document community feedback. Although benefits vary depending on project area due to their proximity to local communities and access to resource project offered life insurance, some projects created investment groups to incentivize savings, donations were given to local schools and communities such as water tanks, gas to voluntary fire men, resource donations for infrastructure development, restoration of roads, supervised practices in administrative offices, authorized use of local rivers and springs, donations for local festivities, church remodelation, and donation of pipes for local sewage. The projects expects to have biodiversity benefits such as serving as a buffer zone and biological corridor for the natural forests and areas of High Conservation Value, avoided deforestation, sustainable management to reduce chemical inputs, positive impacts on the environment (such as degraded soil, restore water recharge and mitigate wind effects) given the change from pasture to natural rubber tree plantations, and the project will also have an aesthetic positive impact on the landscape.",

At the end of their productive life span, the trees will be harvested for timber and the plantation will be replanted as stated in the Management Plans”. In addition, in the evaluation of Risk factor applicable to ARR projects, Section 1.11, the risk rating for Long-term commitment with harvesting was defined as Medium, in where Project Proponent again states the intention to replant. Despite the evidence for replanting, the Project Proponent has no legal agreement or requirement as AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk requires.
