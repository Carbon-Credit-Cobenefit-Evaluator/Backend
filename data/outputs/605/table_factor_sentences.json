L U T Economic risk: Risk of rising land opportunity Low Since the project is intended to protect (rather than grow) costs that cause reversal of forest, reversal of sequestration is not a risk (compared to, for sequestration and/or protection example, afforestation/reforestation projects). The main consideration is therefore reversal of protection. ikely land opportunity costs will arise from high prices for animal products (creating a risk of conversion to pasture) or high demand for timber (creating a risk of either conversion to plantation or a resumption of logging). ntil 2015, the landowner can only convert land to plantation or pasture at a rate of 40ha per year. There are unlikely to be significant changes in land opportunity costs between now and 2015, and the landowner will thereafter not be permitted to clearfell the native forests for conversion. This provides protection against rising land opportunity costs if meat, wool or plantation timber significantly increase in value. he risk of an increasing value of native forest timber is addressed in sub-section 1b, under ‘high timber value’.",
    "risk_factor High timber value; vcs-designated_risk_rating_for_ifm_projects Medium; comments T A For the majority of the project’s lifetime, the main opportunity cost for the land is the loss of income from harvesting the native forest. The majority of extracted timber (+90%) is used for pulp and paper. This is a very low-value product: prices have hovered around $8-10/ton over recent years63, and are continuing to decline as international markets demand plantation-sourced wood products. Forest carbon prices historically compare favourably: in 2009, the average price in compliance markets was over US$10/ton64. ypically, as the forests recover from logging, the opportunity cost of not logging increases. This is because a growing proportion of the merchantable timber will consist of sawlog rather than pulp or paper. At roughly $35/ton65, prime sawlog has a much higher value than either alternative wood products or – historically – carbon. However, this property has limited capacity to produce sawlog, due to the heavy logging of the past. Therefore, almost all of the timber harvest would be used for low-value pulp and paper. There is therefore little risk to the long-term carbon stocks from high timber value on this property. fter completion of the project, it is probable that most",

D Only 5.6% of the Tasmanian population are employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing67. More specifically, between 2006 and 2010, the number of people employed in harvesting and processing timber (the affected industries) declined from 4528 to 3216 people. Among those forestry workers working with native forests, employment declined from 3459 to 2033. In short, logging of native forests employs only a tiny proportion of the 200 000 strong Tasmanian workforce, and the industry is declining rapidly due to mechanisation, poor demand and a shift towards plantations68. By contrast, tourism employs 6.1% of workers (some 13 600 people) and the professional, scientific and technical sector employs 4.5% of the workforce69. Both these areas frequently offer higher wages and more scope for skill development. They will be encouraged by the Redd Forests' IFM projects, which enhances the aesthetics of the countryside through forest protection and generate demand for environmental expertise. eclining unemployment will not threaten the permanence of the emission reductions because the project is on private property: the landowner’s decision to implement an Improved",

As evidence, The Torrens Land Title legislation that determines the legal ownership (and use) of land within Australia confers 100% of the land management responsibility and use to the landowner. Due to the nature of the forest within the project area, (being assigned for commercial logging, primarily for low value products) and the legal structures governing land ownership and use within Australia, there are no communities that rely on the project areas for fuel, food, fodder, medicines or building materials. As evidence, the land is also subject to private timber reserves which ‘enable landowners to have their land dedicated for long-term forest management'. As further evidence, the key feature of Torrens Land Titles, is that it captures all interests in a property, including transfers, mortgages, leases, easements, covenants, resumptions and other rights",

F Illegal logging is de minimis in Tasmania. Forest harvesting on private land can only occur with the consent of the landowner, and property boundaries are well-marked and recognised within Tasmania. Secondly, the major markets for forest products are saw millers and three large export woodchip mills. Timber can only be sold in these markets when associated with an approved Forest Practices Plan. There is routine monitoring by Forest Practices Officers, formal reporting on compliance and additional independent monitoring across a representative sample of FPPs. High clearance rates within the FPPS indicates that the main threat to native forests in Tasmania is legal rather than illegal logging. irewood extraction within Tasmania does occur but the impact upon forest carbon stocks is negligible for the following reasons: 1. Large dead hollow-bearing trees and fallen timber are the two timber types most targeted by wood cutters66. 2. Firewood collection tends t occur within public roadsides.

Regulatory and social risk: Risk of political instability Very low Australia has a long history of political and social stability. The main source of contention in Tasmania has been between Risk of social instability Very low. the logging industry and environmental groups. Logging has historically provided a major source of employment and income, and environmental campaigns for forest conservation have arguably not recognised the socio-economic impact of banning logging of native forests. Carbon financed IFM projects arguably provide a synthesis between these two positions, providing comparable employment to foresters and income to landowners while protecting the carbon stocks and biodiversity of Tasmania’s native forests. This should help ameliorate any political and social tension associated with land use management in Tasmania.",
