  "SDG_1_No_Poverty": [
    "The project was implemented in response to the ongoing logging of native forests within Tasmania, previously the only means to generate income from native forests.",
    "This demonstrates that the forest has historically faced—and will continue to face—intensive logging pressure unless the land can be used to generate alternative income streams.",
    "The project proponents’ future capacity to log their native forests may be constrained by policy shifts.",
    "This will support local biodiversity conservation, maintain watersheds, and enhance carbon stocks.",
    "Logging has historically provided a major source of employment and income, and environmental campaigns for forest conservation have arguably not recognised the socio‑economic impact of banning logging of native forests.",
    "Rather, IFM projects will stop not only logging of native forests within the project area, but also establish carbon finance as a competitive land use.",
    "The local community benefits from the conservation of the native forest.",
    "Logging has historically provided a major source of employment and income, and environmental campaigns for forest conservation have arguably not recognised the socio‑economic impact of banning v3.0 NON-PERMANENCE RISK REPORT: VCS Version 3 logging of native forests.",
    "The project scenario involves protecting native forest.",
    "Indeed, historical logging of the project site, recent logging concessions, and ongoing logging in the region demonstrate that the risk of deforestation is real, legal, and imminent.",
    "The owners are seeking an alternative that will provide them with comparable income while protecting and improving the native forests of the region.",
    "The project will also have the additional benefits of enhancing local biodiversity (which is undermined by harvesting events and practices), diversifying landowners’ income, and maintaining both aesthetic and recreational values of the Tasmanian landscape.",
    "With regard to generating net positive impacts on the social and economic well‑being of the local communities who derive livelihoods from the project area, in the case of Tasmanian projects, this refers to the landowner (project proponent).",
    "Finally, the alternative land use is forest harvesting.",
    "Other Land Use (AFOLU) Project Activities",
    "This project is on the private land of a family who have owned and logged the land for over one hundred years.",
    "Specifically, these native forests are managed to meet set quotas of high‑quality sawlog (300,000 m³ per annum from 2010 to 2030), with pulp and other wood products produced as byproducts of the sawlog harvesting process.",

    "34. Green, G. (2004). Plantation Forestry in Tasmania: The current resource, current processing, and future opportunities. Timber Workers for Forests.",
    "Improved forest management is not a financially competitive land use without carbon finance, because it generates no other revenue; this type of project is also uncommon in the region.",
    "Owning large areas of land and engaging in activities such as grazing and cropping provides an opportunity to leverage funding to cover the modest ongoing project costs, without including revenue from credit sales.",
    "This helps diversify income sources, providing financial security as demand for native timber declines, while improving the region's environmental integrity.",
    "For most of the project's lifetime, the main opportunity cost of the land is the loss of income from harvesting the native forest.",
    "Given the landowner's intentions and legal right to continue forest harvesting, continuing the pre-project activity is only plausible with carbon finance.",
    "This is supported by the fact that each project constitutes only a relatively minor part of other agricultural activities on land owned by the proponent.",
    "An IFM project is intended to maintain and enhance carbon stocks in native forests for twenty-five years, preventing emissions from business-as-usual logging practices.",
    "The project is specifically eligible under the VCS‑approved “Methodology for Improved Forest Management: Conversion of Logged to Protected Forests.”",
    "This will deter landowners from either ongoing selective logging or converting native forests to plantations or pasture to compensate for declining logging revenue.",
    "Rather, they provide one of the few mechanisms to protect native forests while generating a competitive return.",
    "Such action would also negate any landowner income derived from the sale of carbon credits—that is, the project scenario.",
    "Firstly, carbon credits may continue to increase in value, especially those with biodiversity and socioeconomic premiums, such as Redd Forests’ projects.",
    "This would renew pressure on native forests on private and public land and would be evident in ongoing annual verification events for each project.",
    "It also must be recognized that the market value of each carbon credit would need to be less than $0.20 (AU) for the ongoing project costs to not be covered by credit sales.",
    "The owner of the harvest rights acts as the project proponent and undertakes forest protection as an alternative to harvesting.",
    "Define alternatives to the project activity: In this scenario, the project activity involves continuing the pre-project land use—keeping the native forest standing—using carbon finance to generate revenue from improved forest management.",
    "Summary: Pressure on native forests fluctuates, especially on private land where landowners log in response to market shifts.",
    "Each project proponent has other income sources and potentially credit that provides callable financial resources.",
    "The project proponent seeks to use carbon finance to protect a forest from further logging, especially the clearfelling recently implemented on much of the project site.",
    "Reversal of sequestration is not a risk for forests, unlike afforestation or reforestation projects.",
    "The historical baseline logging and clearfelling with natural regeneration is a land use that will continue in the absence of carbon finance.",
    "It is worth noting that constraints on public land may actually increase pressure on private native forests.",
    "Moreover, these projects create alternative employment sources, including fieldwork to assess and monitor forests protected under VCS IFM projects.",
    "(CRC for Forestry: Hobart) The pressure on native forests is intense because landowners believe their future income may be constrained by the shift in demand toward plantation-sourced timber, notably by the proposed Gunns’ pulp mill, and because of high-level discussions about constraining logging of native forests.",
    "It is therefore very plausible that project proponents will seek to continue protecting their forests using forest carbon projects rather than resume logging.",
    "However, the project proponent and developer hope that successful projects will encourage landowners to use VCS and carbon finance, thereby protecting the biodiversity and carbon sinks of native and old-growth forests in Tasmania.",
    "The project activity generates income only from the sale of carbon credits.",
    "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Voluntary Carbon Standard. 1.1 Project title: Protection of a Tasmanian Native Forest (Project 1: Redd Forests’ Pilot). 1.2 Type/Category of the project: Improved Forest Management (IFM), specifically conversion of logged forests to protected forests (LtPf). 1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period including project size:",
    "Secondly, there is a high probability of a policy shift toward the end of the project’s lifetime, as social and cultural norms tend toward environmental conservation.",
    "This program was developed by Private Forests Tasmania, a statutory authority funded by the Tasmanian government and private forest owners.",
    "There are unlikely to be significant changes in land opportunity costs between now and 2015, and the landowner will thereafter not be permitted to clearfell native forests for conversion.",
    "This increases the threat to native forests under existing concessions or in legally permitted logging areas, such as the project site.",
    "By protecting the forest from logging, environmental outcomes such as biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and water quality are safeguarded compared with the impacts of ongoing selective logging or clearfelling for conversion, which is legally permitted, if not the most plausible baseline scenario.",
    "Given that the project represents passive land management and no infrastructure or large-scale ground disturbance will be associated with it, it does not represent a ‘significant impact’ and therefore does not require referral under the EPBC Act.",
    "The Pilot Project area includes 865 ha of native forest, including small stands of old growth.",
    "This information provided the yield and waste generated under a timber harvest plan of clearfelling with native regeneration.",
    "They will either clearfell their land and allow natural regeneration, which generates the highest possible immediate return. This was historical practice on much of Redd Forests’ pilot project, where a quarter of the property was clearfelled in 2006.",
    "Under the conditions of the contract agreement with Forests Alive, by the time the projects reach validation, the entirety of the project costs is already paid.",
    "2.3.2(3) requires the demonstration that a participatory assessment of the positive and negative impacts of the project activities on the local communities who derive livelihoods from the project area has been completed and demonstrates net positive benefits to the social and economic well-being of these communities.",
    "During selective logging, some trees will be left standing to support natural regeneration and allow landowners to achieve maximum sustainable yield.",
    "By avoiding continued forest harvesting and associated destruction of habitat, this project will help alleviate the dire pressure on a unique and vulnerable ecosystem.",
    "The project is located in the Northern Midlands of Tasmania, Australia.",
    "Likely land opportunity costs will arise from high prices for animal products, creating a risk of conversion to pasture, or from high demand for timber, creating a risk of conversion to plantation or resumption of logging.",
    "This is because native forests are already harvested at the maximum sustainable rate in response to a steadily declining demand.",
    "The baseline scenario will involve extensive selective logging of the standing native forest, followed by natural regeneration.",
    "Also, please provide evidence that there have been no newly acquired commercially viable forestlands outside the Project Area and no dispositions within the Project Area during the monitoring period.",
    "The project is designed to protect 790 hectares of native Tasmanian forest that would, if not for the project, continue to undergo selective logging.",
    "Therefore, although this project will permanently reduce harvest levels within the Project Area, there is no capacity or incentive for timber harvesting to shift to other forests in Australia.",
    "The timber would be transported by logging trucks along established logging tracks on the property to the main roads adjacent to the property, and from there to one of the woodchip mills at Triabunna on the east coast of Tasmania.",
    "The timber harvest plan for each stratum is based on a standing merchantable volume of 149 m³ ha⁻¹ at the project’s start date.",
    "They will either clear‑fell their land and allow natural regeneration, which generates the highest possible immediate return; this was historical practice on much of Forest Alive’s pilot project, where a quarter of the property was clear‑felled in 2006.",
    "This constitutes an annual harvest of private native forests equal to 10 % of the average volume from the preceding 10‑year period.",
    "The legal contract between the landowner and Forests Alive provides evidence for this and is available for review by the project validator.",
    "Section 2.3.2.3 states: \"To achieve the mitigation credit, it shall be demonstrated that a current participatory assessment of the positive and negative impacts of the project activities on the local communities who derive livelihoods from the project area has been completed and demonstrates net positive benefits for the social and economic well‑being of these communities.\"",
    "Alternatively, they will log to obtain the maximum sustainable yield, which involves harvesting roughly 70 % of biomass every twenty to twenty‑five years, as exemplified by the baseline scenario for this project area.",
    "Typically, as the forests recover from logging, the opportunity cost of not logging increases.",
    "It would be financially attractive to log these properties at a sustainable rate to maintain a flow of revenue; in short, the financial incentives support a sustainable selective logging approach.",
    "However, they also have the option of letting the forest stand without any logging or carbon‑financed protection.",
    "Forest Practices Plans (or the state equivalent) are organized by landowners or their representatives.",
    "The creation of the Redd Forests’ pilot project aims to protect native forests from further logging activities and avoid the resulting GHG emissions in an area under great land‑use pressure in the Northern Midlands, Tasmania.",
    "The landowners’ decision to use carbon finance to convert logged forests to protected forests has generated considerable interest across Tasmania.",
    "Due to the nature of the forest within the project area—being assigned for commercial logging, primarily for low‑value products—and the legal structures governing land ownership and use within Australia, there are no communities that rely on the project areas for fuel, food, fodder, medicines, or building materials.",
    "This is because the project activity seeks to reduce business‑as‑usual carbon emissions through improved forest management; it requires no additional activity beyond preventing the clearance and conversion planned by the landowner.",
    "In this way, severe degradation and loss of biodiversity will continue unless new initiatives allow for improved land management practices, including forest conservation.",
    "Since the project is intended to protect (rather than grow) costs that cause reversal of sequestration and/or protection, regulatory and social risk:",
